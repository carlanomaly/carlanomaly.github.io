        Since the dataset is generated by a simulation, you are free to use it under the conditions of the MIT license.

        The full dataset is 1.3T in size. Most of this is the LiDAR pointclouds. You can download it from [Academic Torrents](#) or via `https` as described below.

        ### Parts

        The dataset can be downloaded in parts

        - [Base](#) - Front Camera + additional sensors (GNSS, IMU, Weather) + Anomaly Labels
        - [Camera Extended](#) - Left, Right, Rear camera sensor, including instance segmentation masks and anomaly-labels
        - [LiDAR](#) - Pointclouds and labels in Kitti format
        - [Depth Maps](#) - Depth maps for all cameras
        - [Carla Recordings](#) - Carla logs which can be used to reproduce a simulated scenario

        You can download and set up the base dataset with

        ```bash
        cd my/data/dir/
        wget https://files.kondas.de/carlanomaly/base.tar.gz
        tar -xzf base.tar.gz
        ```

        Afterwards, download additional data with

        ```bash
        cd my/data/dir/
        wget https://files.kondas.de/carlanomaly/<name>.tar.gz
        tar -xzf <name>.tar.gz
        ```
